Pure-Haskell SSH2 (RFC 4250-4254) client implementation.

**It is just few steps from initial commit, nothing really working**

Now it just builds `test` executable which connects to localhost:12345,
sends and receives handshake and key exchange message.

Goal

Implement all MUSTs in RFCs, create useful tool.
